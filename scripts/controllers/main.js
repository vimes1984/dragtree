  /*
Sportsman Tree:

After the two top lights go on (the pre-stage light and the staging light), there is a half second delay between the amber lights and between the last amber light and the green light.
After the pre-stage and the staging light, there should be about 3 seconds delay before the amber light start.  
This can be anywhere from 1-3 seconds but not more than 3 seconds.  This can be random.
